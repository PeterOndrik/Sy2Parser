# ANTLR (ANother Tool for Language Recognition)
## Introduction

[ANTLR](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4) is a parser generator.

ANTLR is actually made up of two main parts:
1.	The tool, used to generate the lexer and parser.
2.	The runtime, needed to run them.

The tool will be needed only for a developer, while the runtime will be included in the final software using your language. The tool is always the same no matter which language you are targeting. The runtime must be available both to the developer and to the user.

## Requirements
1. Installed at least Java 1.7
2. The ANTLR latest version, which is at the moment antlr-4.7.1-complete.jar
3. The ANTLR Mega Tutorial
